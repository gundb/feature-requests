# gun-extensions

This repo exists so people can **suggest or request *new* extensions, modules, plugins, drivers**, what have you, for [gun](http://gun.js.org/).

If there's a tool you'd like to see, submit [an issue in this repo](https://github.com/gundb/gun-extensions/issues)! :)

A **list of existing extensions and modules** is available in the [github.com/amark/gun/wiki](https://github.com/amark/gun/wiki#modules). If you've written an extension or a module, please add it to this wiki page to help get publicity.

If you have found a bug on an existing plugin/extension/whatever please post an issue there!

Cheers!
